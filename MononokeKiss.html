	    					<h2>It's not worth your time</h2>
	    					<h4>The Plot:</h4>
                <p>
                Welcome to being a fabulous princess.  OMG!  There goes your posh life, your Daddy's dead.  In exchange, fate has provided you with serveral hot men with super powers.  It has also provided a reasonably hot antagonist who wants to bang you reguardless of your thoughts on the matter.  Gross.
                Let's flee your castle and begin our exciting adventure!
                </p>
                <h4>The Setting:</h4>
                <p>
                Let's spice up this fairly standard set-up with Yokai and an ancient japanese setting.  It's worth mentioning at this point that the art in this game is definitly the highlight.  The dialogue ranges from stiff and forced to solidly heart-fluttering, including some sex scenes that I found unbelievable, but not in the good way.
                </p>
                <h4>The Guys:</h4>
                <p>
                I found the characters fairly engaging and appealing.  However, sometimes it felt like their actions were random.  I only delved into one character story, >Name<'s normal ending.  I enjoyed it overall, but the pace of the game made it impossible for me to loose myself in the story, not that it got particularly deep.  I did really enjoy the Jealousy themed free side stories they had at the time I was playing.  They were free to read and I felt like they really let me get to know the characters.  Far more engaging and well written than the actual game play.
                </p>

                <p>
                I also tried out the Halloween DLC.  It was terrible.  BAD, BAD writting.  (Although again, I only went through PLACEHOLDER's story).  The costumes were cute though.  In fact, it may have been worth it just for this one single image:
                </P>

                <h4>Verdict:  Skip it.</h4>
                <p>
                Mononoke Kiss isn't worth the effort.  As I mentioned, the main story is shallow and mediocre.  To make matters worse, the game milks you for every iota of the game's 3 different currencies.  Unless you're ready to really shell out some serious cash, the story is disjoined and doled out a paragraph or less at time.  I don't mind paying for games, either with money or advertising, but this game is over priced.  This game is overpriced if you pay with money or if you pay with time, it just isn't good value for the time spent.
                </P>
                <h4>Disclaimers:</h4>
                	<p>
			<ul>
                	<li>I don't have a lot of patients for time based micro-transaction games</li>
                	<li>I've only played 3-4 otome games</li>
                	<li>I'm familiar with anime/manga romance tropes, and am not bothered by them</li> 
                	<li>I usually judge a game's cash value based on what I think I would pay for something similar on steam or 3DS, usually between $20 and $40..I still have trouble getting used to $60, even though it's been the standard for AAA titles for ages</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
                <h4>Trigger warning analysis:</h4>
                <p>
                I can't speak for all routes, but in the one I went through, there were a couple non-consensual groping scenes that I could have lived without (with the antagonist - I don't think you have to worry about the rape leads to romance trope here)  (BTW the presence of that trope in ANYTHING is basically an auto fail as far as I'm concerned)</P>
